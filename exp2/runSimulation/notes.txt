  honing in on final settings:

    ## TRUE PARAMETERS -- SIGNAL
    lossAversionFixed <- 2
    ## these two are reverse
    ## smaller is stronger
    exponentsFixed <- .70
    pWeightFixed <- .80

    ## RANDOM EFFECTS -- NOISE
    ## such that subject parameters have about a .4 correlation with true parameters
    exponentsRandom <- .35
    lossAversionRandom <- .60
    pWeightRandom <- .20
    interceptRandom <- 3.5
    ## within-subject noise
    noiseSd <- 2

    at bias = 1, n = 100, nSims = 5
      difficulty power = 1; avg difficulty effect size = .53
    at bias = .4, n = 100, nSims = 5
      difficulty power = .2; avg difficulty effect size = .13
    at bias = .4, n = 20, nSims = 5
      difficulty power = 0; avg difficulty effect size = .23

  interesting to note that, if only loss aversion is active, there's no difference in risk preferences across the conditions

  thinking about the modeling:
    run the prospect theory algorithm as intended across both prospects
    compute difference in value, convert to probability
    inputs to value function are still deviation from reference, in this case 8
    within-subject noise added to the final difference, before converting to probability

  i think im at a point where:
    the decision function is working correctly
    the subject-level noise is calibrated appropriately
  still need to calibrate fixed effects

  it's actually starting to really concern me that diminishing sensitivity is present in the data even if the prospect function is linear
    it's a function of the softmax or whatever that converts to probability space
    the floor and ceiling crush the slope, making everything look like diminishing sensitivity...
    this could be a problem in practice
      you can't choose a deck more than all the time
