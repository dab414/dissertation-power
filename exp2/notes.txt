exp2 power analysis

try to think of it like im inputting one term that pushes all the means in the predicted direction to some extent..
less of like each individual effect

so yea i think implementing the parameter to simulate over as like just a global modifier to all the coefficients in the model would work
	or the bias is the coefficient lol
	the coefficient is constant across all fixed effects

	although idk i think there needs to be some notion of scale here
	the increase in p(lDemand) for each unit increase in time should be smaller than the difference between conditions of the other manipulations

what about something like this:

p(lowDemand) = (intercept + difficulty*difficultyB + difference*differenceB + difference*difficulty*twoWay) * t

the whole thing scales as a function of time
	time <- seq(0, 1, length.out = nTrials)
	for (t in time)
