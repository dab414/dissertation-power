changed everything to be on a log odds scale
roughly -5 : 5 are at the ends of the probability scale

bias of .9 can be detected with 100% power with N = 10
bias of 0.1 can only be detected with 40% power with N = 100
  avg effect size = 0.03

between-subject variance parameters:
  intSd <- 3
    i expect this to be quite large in the observed data
  betaSd <- 0.5
    increasing this will actually increase the extent to which the ANOVA will detect the effect.. 
  
within-subject variance:
  noiseSd <- 0.25
    i don't have great intuitions as to what to set this to
    it feels like this will just influence the scale of bias
      higher noise just means i need to raise bias that much more for the effect to be detected

the one concern i have about deriving effect size from the anova is that it might imply that N and effect size aren't independent
