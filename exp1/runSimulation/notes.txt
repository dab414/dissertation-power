exp1 power analysis

  i think everything is mostly ready to go
  having the bias at < 0.4 makes the 'difference' effect size so small as to be negligible
    avg difference effect size of .08 at 10 sims of 100 subjects at bias = 0.4
    eh actually i might start the bias at .4 to catch effect size = 0.1
  also going to set the true loss aversion effect from 3 to 2 because it definitely seems relatively stronger than diminishing sensitivity
  
  id like to play around with hyper threading 
    i dont know it well enough to know a priori whether or not it will work.. so there's only one way to find out

  the below model won't work anymore
    need to be more sophisticated.. model diminishing sensitivity specifically
  i think i just need to straight up implement prospect theory
    then weight each parameter in prospect theory by a global scalar that ill simulate over
    ^^ with the exponents, you actually need to reverse weight
      0 means more curve, 1 essentially means linear
        i realized that converting log odds to probability always looks S-shaped... not sure what that means for my purposes
          eh, i just messed around and it doesn't look that S-shaped when it's linear... who knows

  im finally at a point where im really happy with how the decision function is working
    i think i just need to set up all the loops now...

try to think of it like im inputting one term that pushes all the means in the predicted direction to some extent..
less of like each individual effect

so yea i think implementing the parameter to simulate over as like just a global modifier to all the coefficients in the model would work
	or the bias is the coefficient lol
	the coefficient is constant across all fixed effects

	although idk i think there needs to be some notion of scale here
	the increase in p(lDemand) for each unit increase in time should be smaller than the difference between conditions of the other manipulations

what about something like this:

p(lowDemand) = (intercept + difficulty*difficultyB + difference*differenceB + difference*difficulty*twoWay) * t

the whole thing scales as a function of time
	time <- seq(0, 1, length.out = nTrials)
	for (t in time)
