# Power Analyses for Dissertation Experiments

This repository contains the R scripts and summaries of all the simulations carried out to conduct power analyses (for the purpose of estimating sample sizes) for my dissertation.

## Experiment 1

### Simulation Scripts  

* [`powerSimulator.r`](runSimulation/powerSimulator.r): The script used to execute the simulations.  
* [`hyperParameterTuning.r`](runSimulation/hyperParameterTuning.r'): The script used to vary the *effect size* and *sample size* parameters.

### Summary Scripts  

* [`powerSummary.html`](https://davebraun.org/dissertation/experiments/power/exp1/)
